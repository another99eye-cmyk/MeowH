🎃 Haunted Crash Simulator

A harmless illusion, wrapped in code and fear.

🕯️ Overview

Haunted Crash Simulator is a Halloween-themed Python prank program that mimics a system malfunction.
When executed, it opens an eerie dialogue box reading:

“This program has crashed.”

Attempting to “Resolve” it leads to a full-screen blue screen of death (BSOD-like) illusion — locking the user in a chilling loop of dread until they press the secret escape key.

No files are deleted. No real system damage occurs.
It’s all smoke and mirrors — an illusion meant to unnerve, not harm.

⚙️ Features

🧱 Fake crash dialogue that cannot be closed normally.
💀 Full-screen system takeover simulating a crash screen.
